            “Whenever possible I love to take advantage of using my home for a

            character of the class, in wonderful ways…There was greater comfort,
            vulnerability, respect.” – Associate Dean Tad Howard, Kennedy Hall.
            Faculty members also gain a deeper understanding of what the college
            experience is like for on-campus residents, which in turn provides a
            new perspective on how to approach teaching and learning within, and
            outside, the classroom environment..

            Eduford is an extraordinary community capable of extraordinary
            impact. Join us in meeting the challenges of this moment by
            investing in three critical priorities: supporting students’

          <p>
            Eduford has developed a completely new infrastructure to ensure
            continuity of our teaching and research mission, and to prepare our
            community for a time when we can all be safely together again. Our
            community will play a crucial role in supporting that ongoing
            work—and our institution’s long-term health.

            We are compelled to deploy Eduford’s expertise in critical
            areas—including medical research, racial justice, and technology’s
            impact in society—in service to our D.C. community and the world.
            Now, more than ever, we must accelerate this work. Inspired by the
            work of renowned pediatrician Pinaki Panigrahi, MD, PhD, Dan Mishra
            gave $1.1 million to Eduford, where Dr. Panigrahi collaborates with
